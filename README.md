# vinchiqqq-SS
A roblox backdoor executor✅️
-
This script scans the game for a remote called "infected" in the game.

⚠️DISCLAIMER⚠️
-
I don't consider user to exploit, hack any game. Use this only for testing.

I provide you a tutorial and infection script✅️
-
So. First download the "vinchiqqq SS.lua" file, and execute this script
in YOUR game. Okay so normally click the "inject" button then 
check the developer console for the output.
It would say something like "Remote not found".

How to infect YOUR game❔❔️
-
Download file named "inject script.lua" and copy the script. Now, create
a ServerScript (or just script) in the ServerScriptStorage and paste there the inject script. Now when our
game is infected, we take one more step. Click on the ServerScriptService
open up properties, and turn on "Enable Loadstring", click OK. And boom!
Your game is infected with backdoor. If it still doesn't work create "infected"
remote manually in the ReplicatedStorage.
